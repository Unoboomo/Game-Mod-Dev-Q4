Quake Tower Defense

Quake TD is a Bloons TD remake in Quake 4. Place towers to survive increasingly difficult waves of enemies.

Installation:
Step 1: Download the repository files. You can do this by clicking the green “<> Code” dropdown and downloading and extracting the ZIP file. Alternatively, you can clone the repository.

Step 2: If you do not own Quake 4 already, get it. I would recommend through steam, making sure to open the game before continuing so the steam key registers (or something I forget). Then, navigate to your Quake 4 Steam folder (library page, settings icon, manage, browse local files). Copy and paste the Quake TD folder from the repository into the Steam folder.

Step 3: Launch the game, then click on the “mods” button at the bottom of the home screen. From there, click on the “Quake TD option” button and click “Load Mod.” Once the mod has loaded, navigate to settings and click “Load Defaults” and “Yes” to get the default key binds working. Then, optionally, go to system and turn down the volume, cause its pretty annoying.

The Game:

Once you spawn in, you will see an character to the far right (Track_End) and one to the far left (Track_Start). The one to the right (Track_End) represents your health. When that character dies, you will die and need to restart. The character to the left (Track_Start) represents where bloons will spawn. 

In your weapon wheel, you have an Upgrade Gun, and 5 different tower options:
-	Upgrade Gun: Shoot placed towers to upgrade them if the funds are available. (Tip – shoot from a distance where you can’t see the tower’s name)
-	Dart Monkey: Just shoots the bloons. Upgrades increase pierce and damage infinitely. Damage Type is sharpness.
-	Shotty Monkey: Follows Bloons around and shoots them with a shotgun. Upgrades increase pierce and damage infinitely. Damage type is sharpness.
-	Magic Monkey: Shoots bloons with a fast moving projectile. Upgrades increase damage infinitely, at level 5 you unlock tracking projectiles. Damage type is energy.
-	Rocket monkey: Shoots rockets at bloons that deal radius damage. Upgrades increase damage and explosion radius infinitely, at level 5 you unlock tracking projectiles. Damage type is explosion.
-	Tack Shooter: Deals damage in an area around itself. Upgrades increase damage and damage radius infinitely. Damage type is energy.

To purchase a tower, simply shoot the desired gun at the desired location. If funds are available, the tower will be purchased and placed.

Once you feel confident in your tower layout, press the “l” key. The “l” key is the “Start Next Round” key. Once you do, you will get some start of round cash, and bloons will spawn at the far left character. Don’t let them hit Track_End, or you will start taking damage. Pop the bloons to get some extra cash. Once the round ends, you can place down more towers, or press “l” again to start the next round. Once you complete all the rounds, You Win! Good luck, but be careful, some of the bloons are immune to some damage types, and some spawn children:
-	Red Bloon: Immunities – None, Children – None
-	Blue Bloon: Immunities – None, Children – None
-	Green Bloon: Immunities – None, Children – None
-	Yellow Bloon: Immunities – None, Children – None
-	Black Bloon: Immunities – explosion, Children – 2x Yellow
-	White Bloon: Immunities – sharpness, Children – None
-	Purple Bloon: Immunities – energy, Children – 2x White
-	Lead Bloon: Immunities – sharpness, Children – 2x Black
-	Camo Bloon: Immunities – sharpness, explosion, Children – 1x Purple, 1x Lead
-	MOAB: Immunities – None, Children – 4x Camo, Health – Lots
